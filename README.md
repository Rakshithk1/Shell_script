# Shell_script
This repository contains various shell scripts that I have written using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 (RHEL 6.3). These scripts cover basic to intermediate tasks, focusing on automation, system administration, and troubleshooting.



            ##The files are created and committed using GIT CLI
